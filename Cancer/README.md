# Cancer Dataset
Here I used SVM to predict whether a cancer lump is malignant or benign. 
The result was also compared with the KNN algorithm.
SVM is a supervised ML algorithm that is used for classification problems.
In this project I learnt:
    - How to use kernels in sklearn
    - How to tune the hyperparameters of an algorithm in sklearn

Test Data Accuracy (Max): 0.9649122807017544
